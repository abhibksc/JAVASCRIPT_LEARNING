    // JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

    // JavaScript, JSON is often used to represent and exchange data between a server and a web application, or between different parts of a program.


}


// JSON data is represented as key-value pairs, similar to JavaScript object literals. Here's an example of a simple JSON object:

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "isStudent": false,
    "grades": [95, 87, 92]
}

// JSON supports a few data types:

// Objects: Enclosed in curly braces {}, representing an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
// Arrays: Ordered lists of values, enclosed in square brackets [].
// Strings: Enclosed in double-quotes " ".
// Numbers: Integers or floating-point numbers.
// Booleans: true or false.
// null: Represents an empty value or absence of data.
