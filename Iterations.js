console.log("About FoR LooP");

// In Java, a for loop is used to iterate over a range of values or elements. The general syntax of a for loop in Java is as follows:

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}

for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    const element = array[index];
    
}


{
    // Ther is a break and continue Keyword which helps to many condition... 
}
